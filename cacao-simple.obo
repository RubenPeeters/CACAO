comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises agents, whether human individuals, groups, or non-human entities such as software applications, algorithms, or automated processes, that interact with digital systems or services by initiating actions, consuming resources, or producing outputs. Users are characterized by their capacity to perform intentional actions within a digital environment, for which they can be held responsible.​\n\nUnlike E21 Person, which is limited to real or assumed human individuals, the class User encompasses a broader range of agents, including non-human actors that operate autonomously or semi-autonomously within digital contexts. This includes, but is not limited to, artificial intelligence models, automated scripts, and other algorithmic entities that engage with web services or digital platforms.​\n\nThe classification of an entity as a User does not necessitate legal personhood or consciousness; rather, it is based on the entity's functional role in interacting with digital systems in a manner that can be documented and attributed.​\n\nExamples:\n- A registered individual accessing an online museum catalog.​\n- An AI-driven recommendation engine suggesting artifacts to users.​\n- A software bot performing automated data curation tasks.​

name: Digital Artefact
comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises identifiable immaterial items, such as digital images, texts, multimedia objects, computer program code, algorithms, or mathematical formulae, that are created, modified, or stored in digital formats. Digital Artefacts have an objectively recognizable structure and are documented as single units. They exist independently of specific physical carriers and can reside on multiple digital mediums simultaneously. While E73 Information Objects encompass a broad range of immaterial items, including those stored in human memory or on physical media, Digital Artefacts are specifically associated with digital technologies. This subclassification aids in distinguishing between general information entities and those uniquely tied to digital environments.​\n\nExamples:\n- A digital photograph of an ancient manuscript.​\n- A 3D model of an archaeological excavation site.​\n- The source code of a software application developed to catalog museum collections.​\n- A dataset containing measurements of physical artefacts.

comment: From wikidata (Q49773): loosely organized effort by a large group of people to achieve a particular set of goals\n\nScope note:\nA Social Movement is a loosely organized effort by a large group of people to achieve a particular set of goals, typically aiming to promote or resist changes in society's structure or values. These movements are characterized by collective action, where individuals unite based on shared beliefs or objectives, often seeking social, political, economic, or cultural transformations. ​\n\nSocial movements differ from formal organizations in that they may lack a defined organizational structure or formal membership, relying instead on informal networks and shared commitments. They can vary widely in size and scope, ranging from localized grassroots initiatives to large-scale national or international campaigns. The methods employed can include protests, demonstrations, advocacy, and other forms of collective action aimed at influencing public opinion and policy. ​\n\nExamples:\n- The Civil Rights Movement in the United States,\n- The Environmental Movement\n- The Feminist Movement,\n- The LGBTQ+ Rights Movement

These movements are typically organized around particular issues or ideologies and seek to bring about change within the political system. They differ from political parties, which aim to gain political office, by focusing on specific goals rather than seeking electoral power. ​\n\nExamples:\n- The Anti-Apartheid Movement, which campaigned against the system of racial segregation in South Africa.​\n- The Tea Party Movement in the United States, advocating for reduced government spending and taxation.​\n- The Brexit Movement, which sought the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union.

Instances of Domain represent specific spheres of human thought or activity, providing a framework for understanding the context, provenance, or thematic classification of cultural heritage information.​\n\nThe Domain class serves as a means to associate cultural heritage entities with particular areas of study or professional practice, facilitating interdisciplinary research and knowledge organization. For example, associating an artifact with the domain of "archaeology" or "art history" helps in understanding its scholarly context and the methodologies applied to its study.​\n\nExamples:\n- Archaeology​\n- Art History​\n- Ethnomusicology​\n- Conservation Science

They may also engage in activities such as publishing, educational programming, and community outreach.​\n\nMuseums can vary widely in scope and specialization, including but not limited to art museums, history museums, science museums, and ethnographic museums.

This includes, but is not limited to, painters, sculptors, musicians, composers, writers, poets, actors, dancers, designers, and multimedia artists. An individual is regarded as an instance of Artist when there exists documented evidence of their engagement in artistic practices or when they are attributed with the authorship, performance, or conceptualization of artistic works, either by themselves or by third parties (such as curators, critics, or historical sources).\n\nArtists may be associated with specific cultural movements, artistic periods, or creative practices. The classification of a Person as an Artist does not require professional status or formal recognition; amateur and self-taught individuals are also included when their artistic activity is documented and contextually significant.\n\nIn bibliographic or curatorial contexts, attribution of a creative work to an individual is sufficient to regard them as an Artist, even if the attribution is anonymous, pseudonymous, or contested.\n\nExamples:\n- Leonardo da Vinci\n- Frida Kahlo\n- William Shakespeare\n- Maya Deren

The class also includes all aggregates of objects made for functional purposes of whatever kind, independent of physical coherence, such as a set of chessmen.​\n\nPhysical Artefacts are distinguished by their tangible nature and intentional creation, serving various purposes such as utility, artistic expression, or cultural significance. They may range from individual items like tools and artworks to assembled collections designed to function as a whole.​\n\nExamples:\n- The Rosetta Stone\n- LNER Class A4 4468 Mallard [the World’s fastest steam locomotive, preserved at the National Railway Museum of York, UK]\n- The Portland Vase

They are often characterized by their unique form, style, and the creative processes involved in their production.​\n\nWhile all artworks are physical artefacts, not all physical artefacts qualify as artworks; the classification depends on the creator's intent and the cultural context attributing artistic value to the object.​\nCIDOC CRM\n\nExamples:\n- The Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci​\n- The Thinker by Auguste Rodin​\n- The Starry Night by Vincent van Gogh​\n- Balloon Dog (Red) by Jeff Koons

(Leach, 2017)\n- Text 25014–32 (E33) is identified by “The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire” (E35). (Gibbon, 2013)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- P1(x,y) ⇒ E1(x)\n- P1(x,y) ⇒ E41(y)\n- P1(x,y) ⇐ (∃z) [E15(z)˄ P140i(x,z) ˄ P37(z,y)]\n- P1(x,y) ⇐ (∃z) [E41(z)˄ P1(x,z) ˄ P139(z,y)]\n

comment: Quantification: many to many, necessary (1,n:0,n)\n\nScope note:\nThis property records the dimension that was observed in an E16 Measurement Event.\nE54 Dimension can be any quantifiable aspect of E70 Thing. Weight, image colour depth and monetary value are dimensions in this sense. One measurement activity may determine more than one dimension of one object.\nDimensions may be determined either by direct observation or using recorded evidence. In the latter case the measured Thing does not need to be present or extant.\nEven though knowledge of the value of a dimension requires measurement, the dimension may be an object of discourse prior to, or even without, any measurement being made.\n\nExamples:\n- The measurement of the height of silver cup 232 on 31(st) August 1997 (E16) observed dimension silver cup 232 height (E54). [which has unit mm (E58), has value 224 (E60)] (fictitious)\n- The carbon 14 dating of the “Schoeninger Speer II” in 1996 (E16) observed dimension the carbon 14 based temporal distance from 1996 to the growth of the wood of the “Schoeninger Speer II” (E60). [The carbon 14 dating of an approximately 400.000 year old complete Old Palaeolithic wooden spear found in Schoeningen, Niederachsen, Germany, in 1995. See also: E16 Measurement.] (Kouwenhoven, 1997)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- P40(x,y) ⇒ E16(x)\n- P40(x,y)⇒ E54(y)\n- P40(x,y) ⇒ P141(x,y)\n
