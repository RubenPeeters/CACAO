Scope note:
This property associates an Entity with a particular Genre. The Genre is defined as a subclass of E55 Type and represents a category of artistic, stylistic, thematic, or aesthetic classification. Whether applied to an artist or a creative work, the property genre consistently indicates the genre within which the work or the artist’s creative output is situated. 

Examples:
- An artist might be associated with the genre \"Impressionism\" to indicate that their body of work is typically aligned with this artistic style.
- A painting (as a physical artefact) may be categorized under \"Portrait\" to denote the genre of the artwork."""@en ;

This property describes the naming or identification of any real-world item by a name or any other identifier. 
This property is intended for identifiers in general use, which form part of the world the model intends to describe, and not merely for internal database identifiers which are specific to a technical system, unless these latter also have a more general use outside the technical context. This property includes in particular identification by mathematical expressions such as coordinate systems used for the identification of instances of E53 Place. The property does not reveal anything about when, where and by whom this identifier was used. A more detailed representation can be made using the fully developed (i.e. indirect) path through E15 Identifier Assignment.
This property is a shortcut for the path from E1 CRM Entity through P140i was attributed by, E15 Identifier Assignment, P37 assigned to E42 Identifier. 
It is also a shortcut for the path from E1 CRM Entity through P1 is identified by, E41 Appellation, P139 has alternative form to E41 Appellation.

Examples:
- The capital of Italy (E53) is identified by “Rome” (E41). (Leach, 2017)
- Text 25014–32 (E33) is identified by “The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire” (E35). (Gibbon, 2013)

This property records the dimension that was observed in an E16 Measurement Event.
E54 Dimension can be any quantifiable aspect of E70 Thing. Weight, image colour depth and monetary value are dimensions in this sense. One measurement activity may determine more than one dimension of one object.
Dimensions may be determined either by direct observation or using recorded evidence. In the latter case the measured Thing does not need to be present or extant.
Even though knowledge of the value of a dimension requires measurement, the dimension may be an object of discourse prior to, or even without, any measurement being made.

Examples:
- The measurement of the height of silver cup 232 on 31(st) August 1997 (E16) observed dimension silver cup 232 height (E54). [which has unit mm (E58), has value 224 (E60)] (fictitious)

A Social Movement is a loosely organized effort by a large group of people to achieve a particular set of goals, typically aiming to promote or resist changes in society's structure or values. These movements are characterized by collective action, where individuals unite based on shared beliefs or objectives, often seeking social, political, economic, or cultural transformations. ​

Social movements differ from formal organizations in that they may lack a defined organizational structure or formal membership, relying instead on informal networks and shared commitments. They can vary widely in size and scope, ranging from localized grassroots initiatives to large-scale national or international campaigns. The methods employed can include protests, demonstrations, advocacy, and other forms of collective action aimed at influencing public opinion and policy. ​

This class comprises categories or fields of specialized knowledge, disciplines, or areas of expertise that are used to classify and contextualize instances of CIDOC CRM classes. Instances of Domain represent specific spheres of human thought or activity, providing a framework for understanding the context, provenance, or thematic classification of cultural heritage information.​

The Domain class serves as a means to associate cultural heritage entities with particular areas of study or professional practice, facilitating interdisciplinary research and knowledge organization. For example, associating an artifact with the domain of \"archaeology\" or \"art history\" helps in understanding its scholarly context and the methodologies applied to its study.​

Examples:
- Archaeology​
- Art History​
- Ethnomusicology​

This class comprises persons who are recognized for engaging in the creation or performance of works in the visual, performing, literary, or applied arts. This includes, but is not limited to, painters, sculptors, musicians, composers, writers, poets, actors, dancers, designers, and multimedia artists. An individual is regarded as an instance of Artist when there exists documented evidence of their engagement in artistic practices or when they are attributed with the authorship, performance, or conceptualization of artistic works, either by themselves or by third parties (such as curators, critics, or historical sources).

Artists may be associated with specific cultural movements, artistic periods, or creative practices. The classification of a Person as an Artist does not require professional status or formal recognition; amateur and self-taught individuals are also included when their artistic activity is documented and contextually significant.

In bibliographic or curatorial contexts, attribution of a creative work to an individual is sufficient to regard them as an Artist, even if the attribution is anonymous, pseudonymous, or contested.

- Leonardo da Vinci
- Frida Kahlo
- William Shakespeare

This class comprises physical artefacts that are primarily created as expressions of aesthetic, conceptual, or symbolic intent. Artworks encompass a wide range of tangible objects produced through artistic practices, including but not limited to paintings, sculptures, installations, and mixed-media pieces.​

Artworks are distinguished by their purpose of conveying artistic expression, emotion, or commentary, rather than serving utilitarian functions. They are often characterized by their unique form, style, and the creative processes involved in their production.​

While all artworks are physical artefacts, not all physical artefacts qualify as artworks; the classification depends on the creator's intent and the cultural context attributing artistic value to the object.​
