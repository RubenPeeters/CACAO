comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises agents, whether human individuals, groups, or non-human entities such as software applications, algorithms, or automated processes, that interact with digital systems or services by initiating actions, consuming resources, or producing outputs. Users are characterized by their capacity to perform intentional actions within a digital environment, for which they can be held responsible.​\n\nUnlike E21 Person, which is limited to real or assumed human individuals, the class User encompasses a broader range of agents, including non-human actors that operate autonomously or semi-autonomously within digital contexts. This includes, but is not limited to, artificial intelligence models, automated scripts, and other algorithmic entities that engage with web services or digital platforms.​\n\nThe classification of an entity as a User does not necessitate legal personhood or consciousness; rather, it is based on the entity's functional role in interacting with digital systems in a manner that can be documented and attributed.​\n\nExamples:\n- A registered individual accessing an online museum catalog.​\n- An AI-driven recommendation engine suggesting artifacts to users.​\n- A software bot performing automated data curation tasks.​

name: Digital Artefact
comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises identifiable immaterial items, such as digital images, texts, multimedia objects, computer program code, algorithms, or mathematical formulae, that are created, modified, or stored in digital formats. Digital Artefacts have an objectively recognizable structure and are documented as single units. They exist independently of specific physical carriers and can reside on multiple digital mediums simultaneously. While E73 Information Objects encompass a broad range of immaterial items, including those stored in human memory or on physical media, Digital Artefacts are specifically associated with digital technologies. This subclassification aids in distinguishing between general information entities and those uniquely tied to digital environments.​\n\nExamples:\n- A digital photograph of an ancient manuscript.​\n- A 3D model of an archaeological excavation site.​\n- The source code of a software application developed to catalog museum collections.​\n- A dataset containing measurements of physical artefacts.

comment: From wikidata (Q49773): loosely organized effort by a large group of people to achieve a particular set of goals\n\nScope note:\nA Social Movement is a loosely organized effort by a large group of people to achieve a particular set of goals, typically aiming to promote or resist changes in society's structure or values. These movements are characterized by collective action, where individuals unite based on shared beliefs or objectives, often seeking social, political, economic, or cultural transformations. ​\n\nSocial movements differ from formal organizations in that they may lack a defined organizational structure or formal membership, relying instead on informal networks and shared commitments. They can vary widely in size and scope, ranging from localized grassroots initiatives to large-scale national or international campaigns. The methods employed can include protests, demonstrations, advocacy, and other forms of collective action aimed at influencing public opinion and policy. ​\n\nExamples:\n- The Civil Rights Movement in the United States,\n- The Environmental Movement\n- The Feminist Movement,\n- The LGBTQ+ Rights Movement

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises actions measuring physical properties and other values that can be determined by a systematic, objective procedure of direct observation of particular states of physical reality. \nAn instance of E16 Measurement may use simple counting or tools, such as yardsticks or radiation detection devices. The interest is in the method and care applied, so that the reliability of the result may be judged at a later stage, or research continued on the associated documents. The date of the event is important for dimensions, which may change value over time, such as the length of an object subject to shrinkage. Methods and devices employed should be associated with instances of E16 Measurement by properties such as P33 used specific technique: E29 Design or Procedure, P125 used object of type: E55 Type, P16 used specific object (was used for): E70 Thing, whereas basic techniques such as "carbon-14 dating" should be encoded using P2 has type (is type of): E55 Type. Details of methods and devices reused or reusable in other instances of E16 Measurement should be documented for these entities rather than the measurements themselves, whereas details of particular execution may be documented by free text or by instantiating adequate sub-activities, if the detail may be of interest for an overarching query.\nRegardless whether a measurement is made by an instrument or by human senses, it represents the initial transition from physical reality to information without any other documented information object in between within the reasoning chain that would represent the result of the interaction of the observer or device with reality. Therefore, determining properties of an instance of E90 Symbolic Object is regarded as an instance of E13 Attribute Assignment, which may be inferred from observing and measuring representative carriers. In the case that the carrier can be named, the property P16 used specific object (was used for) should be used to indicate the instance(s) of E18 Physical Thing that was used as the empirical basis for the attribute assignment. For instance, inferring properties of depicted items using image material, such as satellite images, is not regarded as an instance of E16 Measurement, but as a subsequent instance of E13 Attribute Assignment. Rather, only the production of the images, understood as arrays of radiation intensities, is regarded as an instance of E16 Measurement. The same reasoning holds for other sensor data.\n\nExamples:\n- measurement of the height of silver cup 232 on 31(st) August 1997 (fictitious)\n- the carbon 14 dating of the “Schoeninger Speer II” in 1996 [The carbon 14 dating of an approximately 400.000 year old complete Old Palaeolithic wooden spear found in Schoeningen, Niedersachsen, Germany, in 1995.] (Kouwenhoven, 1997)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E16(x) ⇒ E13(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises real persons who live or are assumed to have lived. \nLegendary figures that may have existed, such as Ulysses and King Arthur, fall into this class if the documentation refers to them as historical figures. In cases where doubt exists as to whether several persons are in fact identical, multiple instances can be created and linked to indicate their relationship. The CIDOC CRM does not propose a specific form to support reasoning about possible identity.\nIn a bibliographic context, a name presented following the conventions usually employed for personal names will be assumed to correspond to an actual real person (an instance of E21 Person), unless evidence is available to indicate that this is not the case. The fact that a persona may erroneously be classified as an instance of E21 Person does not imply that the concept comprises personae.\n\nExamples:\n- Tut-Ankh-Amun (Edwards and Boltin, 1979)\n- Nelson Mandela (Brown and Hort, 2006)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E21(x) ⇒ E20(x)\n- E21(x) ⇒ E39(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises all signs, either meaningful or not, or arrangements of signs following a specific syntax, that are used or can be used to refer to and identify a specific instance of some class within a certain context.\nInstances of E41 Appellation do not identify things by their meaning, even if they happen to have one, but by convention, tradition, or agreement. Instances of E41 Appellation are cultural constructs; as such, they have a context, a history, and a use in time and space by some group of users. A given instance of E41 Appellation can have alternative forms, i.e. other instances of E41 Appellation that are regarded as equivalent, regardless of the thing it denotes.\nDifferent languages may use different appellations for the same thing, such as the names of major cities. Some appellations may be formulated using a valid noun phrase of a particular language. In these cases, the respective instances of E41 Appellation should also be declared as instances of E33 Linguistic Object. Then the language using the appellation can be declared with the property P72 has language: E56 Language.\nInstances of E41 Appellation may be used to identify any instance of E1 CRM Entity and sometimes are characteristic for instances of more specific subclasses of E1 CRM Entity, such as for instances of E52 Time-Span (for instance “dates”), E39 Actor, E53 Place or E28 Conceptual Object. Postal addresses and E-mail addresses are characteristic examples of identifiers used by services transporting things between clients.\nEven numerically expressed identifiers for extents in space or time are also regarded as instances of E41 Appellation, such as Gregorian dates or spatial coordinates, even though they allow for determining some time or location by a known procedure starting from a reference point and by virtue of that fact play a double role as instances of E59 Primitive Value.\nE41 Appellation should not be confused with the act of naming something.

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises sets of coherent phenomena or cultural manifestations occurring in time and space.\nIt is the social or physical coherence of these phenomena that identify an instance of E4 Period and not the associated spatiotemporal extent. This extent is only the “ground” or space in an abstract physical sense that the actual process of growth, spread and retreat has covered. Consequently, different periods can overlap and coexist in time and space, such as when a nomadic culture exists in the same area and time as a sedentary culture. This also means that overlapping land use rights, common among first nations, amounts to overlapping periods.\nOften, this class is used to describe prehistoric or historic periods such as the “Neolithic Period”, the “Ming Dynasty” or the “McCarthy Era”, but also geopolitical units and activities of settlements are regarded as special cases of E4 Period. However, there are no assumptions about the scale of the associated phenomena. In particular all events are seen as synthetic processes consisting of coherent phenomena. Therefore, E4 Period is a superclass of E5 Event. For example, a modern clinical birth, an instance of E67 Birth, can be seen as both a single event, i.e. an instance of E5 Event, and as an extended period, i.e. an instance of E4 Period, that consists of multiple physical processes and complementary activities performed by multiple instances of E39 Actor.\nE4 Period is a subclass of E2 Temporal Entity and of E92 Spacetime Volume. The latter is intended as a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CIDOC CRMgeo (Doerr & Hiebel, 2013). By virtue of this multiple inheritance, it is possible to discuss the physical extent of an instance of E4 Period without representing each instance of it together with an instance of its associated spacetime volume. This model combines two quite different kinds of substance: an instance of E4 Period is a phenomenon while an instance of E92 Spacetime Volume is an aggregation of points in spacetime. However, the real spatiotemporal extent of an instance of E4 Period is regarded to be unique to it due to all its details and fuzziness; its identity and existence depends uniquely on the identity of the instance of E4 Period. Therefore, this multiple inheritance is unambiguous and effective and furthermore corresponds to the intuitions of natural language.\nTypical use of this class in cultural heritage documentation is for documenting cultural and artistic periods. There are two different conceptualisations of ‘artistic style’, defined either by physical features or by historical context. For example, “Impressionism” can be viewed as a period in the European sphere of influence lasting from approximately 1870 to 1905 during which paintings with particular characteristics were produced by a group of artists that included (among others) Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley and Degas. Alternatively, it can be regarded as a style applicable to all paintings sharing the characteristics of the works produced by the Impressionist painters, regardless of historical context. The first interpretation is an instance of E4 Period, and the second defines morphological object types that fall under E55 Type.\nA geopolitical unit as a specific case of an instance of E4 Period is the set of activities and phenomena related to the claim of power, the consequences of belonging to a jurisdictional area and an administrative system that establishes a geopolitical unit. Examples from the modern period are countries or administrative areas of countries such as districts whose actions and structures define activities and phenomena in the area that they intend to govern. The borders of geopolitical units are often defined in contracts or treaties although they may deviate from the actual practice. The spatiotemporal properties of Geopolitical units can be modelled through the properties inherited from E92 Spacetime Volume.\nAnother specific case of an instance of E4 Period is the actual extent of the set of activities and phenomena as evidenced by their physical traces that define a settlement, such as the populated period of Nineveh.\n\nExamples:\n- Jurassic (Hallam, 1975)\n- Populated Period of Nineveh\n- Imperial Rome under Marcus Aurelius\n- European Bronze Age (Harrison, 2004) \n- Italian Renaissance (Macdonald, 1992)\n- Thirty Years War (Lee, 1991)\n- Sturm und Drang (Berkoff, 2013)\n- Cubism (Cox, 2000)\n- The Capital of Russia (E4) [the capital of Russia in the sense of an administrative unit moved in historical times from Moscow to St Petersburg and then back to Moscow. This exemplifies an administrative unit changing place over time without temporal discontinuity]\n- The settling activity of the community of Helsinki (a.k.a. Helsingfors) (E7) [the original settlement called Helsinki was located in the area of the modern airport. The community moved later to settle on the coast. This exemplifies a continued activity changing place over time without temporal discontinuity]\n- Bronze Age (E4) [Bronze Age, in the sense of technological adoption, spread over disjoint areas including islands such as the British Isles without temporal discontinuity]\n- Japan, the state (E4) [In 2021, the Japanese state as a political unit comprised in 6852 islands extending along the Pacific coast of Asia]\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E4(x) ⇒ E2(x)\n- E4(x) ⇒ E92(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises abstract temporal extents, in the sense of Galilean physics, having a beginning, an end, and a duration. \nInstances of E52 Time-Span have no semantic connotations about phenomena happening within the temporal extent they represent. They do not convey any meaning other than a positioning on the “time-line” of chronology. The actual extent of an instance of E52 Time-Span can be approximated by properties of E52 Time-Span giving inner and outer bounds in the form of dates (instances of E61 Time Primitive). Comparing knowledge about time-spans is fundamental for chronological reasoning.\nSome instances of E52 Time-Span may be defined as the actual, in principle observable, temporal extent of instances of E2 Temporal Entity via the property P4 has time-span (is time-span of): E52 Time-Span. They constitute phenomenal time-spans as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr & Hiebel 2013). Since our knowledge of history is imperfect and physical phenomena are fuzzy in nature, the extent of phenomenal time-spans can only be described in approximation. An extreme case of approximation, might, for example, define an instance of E52 Time-Span having unknown beginning, end and duration. It may, nevertheless, be associated with other descriptions by which people can infer knowledge about it, such as in relative chronologies.\nSome instances of E52 may be defined precisely as representing a declaration of a temporal extent, as, for instance, done in a business contract. They constitute declarative time-spans as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr & Hiebel 2013) and can be described via the property E61 Time Primitive P170 defines time (time is defined by): E52 Time-Span. \nWhen used as a common E52 Time-Span for two events, it will nevertheless describe them as being simultaneous, even if nothing else is known.\n\nExamples:\n- 1961\n- From 12-17-1993 to 12-8-1996\n- 14h30 to 16h22 4(th) July 1945\n- 9.30 am 1.1.1999 to 2.00 pm 1.1.1999\n- the time-span of the Ming Dynasty (Chan, 2011)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E52(x) ⇒ E1(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises extents in the natural space where people live, in particular on the surface of the Earth, in the pure sense of physics: independent from temporal phenomena and matter. They may serve describing the physical location of things or phenomena or other areas of interest. Geometrically, instances of E53 Place constitute single contiguous areas or a finite aggregation of disjoint areas in space which are each individually contiguous. They may have fuzzy boundaries.\nThe instances of E53 Place are usually determined by reference to the position of “immobile” objects such as buildings, cities, mountains, rivers, or dedicated geodetic marks, but may also be determined by reference to mobile objects. A Place can be determined by combining a frame of reference and a location with respect to this frame.\nIt is sometimes argued that instances of E53 Place are best identified by global coordinates or absolute reference systems. However, relative references are often more relevant in the context of cultural documentation and tend to be more precise. In particular, people are often interested in position in relation to large, mobile objects, such as ships. For example, the Place at which Nelson died is known with reference to a large mobile object, i.e. H.M.S Victory. A resolution of this Place in terms of absolute coordinates would require knowledge of the movements of the vessel and the precise time of death, either of which may be revised, and the result would lack historical and cultural relevance.\nAny instance of E18 Physical Thing can serve as a frame of reference for an instance of E53 Place. This may be documented using the property P157 is at rest relative to (provides reference space for).\n\nExamples:\n- the extent of the UK in the year 2003\n- the position of the hallmark on the inside of my wedding ring (fictitious)\n- the place referred to in the phrase: “Fish collected at three miles north of the confluence of the Arve and the Rhone”\n- here -> <- [the place between these two arrows in one of the reader's paper copy of this document. Each copy constitutes a different place of this spot.]\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E53(x) ⇒ E1(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises quantifiable properties that can be measured by some calibrated means and can be approximated by values, i.e. points or regions in a mathematical or conceptual space, such as natural or real numbers, RGB values, etc.\nAn instance of E54 Dimension represents the empirical or theoretically derived quantity, including the precision tolerances resulting from the particular method or calculation. The identity of an instance of E54 Dimension depends on the method of its determination because each method may produce different values even when determining comparable qualities. For instance, the wingspan of a bird alive or dead is a different dimension. Thermoluminescence dating and Rehydroxylation [RHX] dating are different dimensions of temporal distance from now, even if they aim at dating the same object. The method of determination should be expressed using the property P2 has type (is type of). Note that simple terms such as “diameter” or “length” are normally insufficient to unambiguously describe a respective dimension. In contrast, “maximum linear extent” may be sufficient.\nThe properties of the class E54 Dimension allow for expressing the numerical approximation of the values of instances of E54 Dimension adequate to the precision of the applied method of determination. If the respective quantity belongs to a non-discrete space according to the laws of physics, such as spatial distances, it is recommended to record them as approximations by intervals or regions of indeterminacy enclosing the assumed true values. For instance, a length of 5 cm may be recorded as 4.5-5.5 cm, according to the precision of the respective observation. Note, that comparability of values described in different units depends critically on the representation as value regions.\nNumerical approximations in archaic instances of E58 Measurement Unit used in historical records should be preserved. Equivalents corresponding to current knowledge should be recorded as additional instances of E54 Dimension, as appropriate.\n\nExamples:\n- the weight of the Luxor Obelisk [250 metric tons]\n- the vertical height of the statue of David by Michelangelo [5.17 metres]\n- the weight of the Great Star of Africa diamond [530.2 carats]\n- the calibrated C14 date for the Shroud of Turin [AD1262-1312, 1303-1384]\n- the horizontal diameter of the Stonehenge Sarsen Circle [33 metres] (Pryor, 2016)\n- the length of the sides of the Great Pyramid at Giza [230.34 metres] (Lehner and Hawass, 2017)\n- the duration of the time-span of the Battle of Issos/Issus on 15(th) November 333 B.C.E. [less than 12 hours] (Howard, 2012)\n- Christie’s hammer price, in British Pounds, for Vincent van Gogh's "Still Life: Vase with Fifteen Sunflowers" in London on 30(th) March 1987 (E97) [24.75 million GBP (British Pounds)]\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E54(x) ⇒ E1(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises distinct, delimited and coherent processes and interactions of a material nature, in cultural, social or physical systems, involving and affecting instances of E77 Persistent Item in a way characteristic of the kind of process. Typical examples are meetings, births, deaths, actions of decision taking, making or inventing things, but also more complex and extended ones such as conferences, elections, building of a castle, or battles.\nWhile the continuous growth of a tree lacks the limits characteristic of an event, its germination from a seed does qualify as an event. Similarly, the blowing of the wind lacks the distinctness and limits of an event, but a hurricane, flood or earthquake would qualify as an event. Mental processes are considered as events, in cases where they are connected with the material externalization of their results; for example, the creation of a poem, a performance or a change of intention that becomes obvious from subsequent actions or declarations.\nThe effects of an instance of E5 Event may not lead to relevant permanent changes of properties or relations of the items involved in it, for example an unrecorded performance. Of course, in order to be documented, some kind of evidence for an event must exist, be it witnesses, traces or products of the event.\nWhile instances of E4 Period always require some form of coherence between its constituent phenomena, in addition, the essential constituents of instances of E5 Event should contribute to an overall effect; for example, the statements made during a meeting and the listening of the audience.\nViewed at a coarse level of detail, an instance of E5 Event may appear as if it had an ‘instantaneous’ overall effect, but any process or interaction of material nature in reality have an extent in time and space. At a fine level, instances of E5 Event may be analysed into component phenomena and phases within a space and timeframe, and as such can be seen as a period, regardless of the size of the phenomena. The reverse is not necessarily the case: not all instances of E4 Period give rise to a noteworthy overall effect and are thus not instances of E5 Event.\n\nExamples:\n- the birth of Cleopatra (E67) (Pomeroy, 1984)\n- the destruction of Herculaneum by volcanic eruption in 79 AD (E6) (Camardo, 2013)\n- World War II (E7) (Barber, 1994)\n- the Battle of Stalingrad (E7) (Hoyt, 1993)\n- the Yalta Conference (E7) (Harbutt, 2010)\n- my birthday celebration 28-6-1995 (E7)\n- the falling of a tile from my roof last Sunday (fictitious)\n- the CIDOC conference 2003 (E7)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E5(x) ⇒ E4(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises the births of human beings. E67 Birth is a biological event focussing on the context of people coming into life. (E63 Beginning of Existence comprises the coming into life of any living being.) \nTwins, triplets, etc. are brought into life by the same instance of E67 Birth. The introduction of the E67 Birth event as a documentation element allows the description of a range of family relationships in a simple model. Suitable extensions may describe more details and the complexity of motherhood since the advent of modern medicine. In this model, the biological father is not seen as a necessary participant in the E67 Birth.\n\nExamples:\n- the birth of Alexander the Great (Stoneman, 2004)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E67(x) ⇒ E63(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises any gatherings or organizations of human individuals or groups that act collectively or in a similar way due to any form of unifying relationship. In the wider sense this class also comprises official positions which used to be regarded in certain contexts as one actor, independent of the current holder of the office, such as the president of a country. In such cases, it may happen that the group never had more than one member. A joint pseudonym (i.e. a name that seems indicative of an individual but that is actually used as a persona by two or more people) is a particular case of E74 Group.\nA gathering of people becomes an instance of E74 Group when it exhibits organizational characteristics usually typified by a set of ideas or beliefs held in common, or actions performed together. These might be communication, creating some common artifact, a common purpose such as study, worship, business, sports, etc. Nationality can be modelled as membership in an instance of E74 Group. Married couples and other concepts of family are regarded as particular examples of E74 Group.\n\nExamples:\n- the Impressionists (Wilson, 1994)\n- the Navajo (Correll, 1972)\n- the Greeks (Williams, 1993)\n- the peace protestors in New York City on 15(th) February 2003\n- Exxon-Mobil (Raymond, 2006)\n- King Solomon and his wives (Thieberger, 1947)\n- the President of the Swiss Confederation\n- Nicolas Bourbaki [the collective pseudonym of a group of mathematicians, predominantly French alumni of the École normale supérieure] (Aczel, 2007)\n- Betty Crocker (Crocker, 2012)\n- Ellery Queen [Ellery Queen is a pseudonym created in 1929 by American crime fiction writers Frederic Dannay and Manfred Bennington Lee.] (Wheat, 2005)\n- Greenpeace\n- Paveprime Ltd\n- the National Museum of Denmark\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E74(x) ⇒ E39(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises the actions of making assertions about one property of an object or any single relation between two items or concepts. The type of the property asserted to hold between two items or concepts can be described by the property P177 assigned property of type (is type of property assigned): E55 Type. \nFor example, the class describes the actions of people making propositions and statements during certain scientific/scholarly procedures, e.g. the person and date when a condition statement was made, an identifier was assigned, the museum object was measured, etc. Which kinds of such assignments and statements need to be documented explicitly in structures of a schema rather than free text, depends on whether this information should be accessible by structured queries.\nThis class allows for the documentation of how the respective assignment came about, and whose opinion it was. Note that all instances of properties described in a knowledge base are the opinion of someone. Per default, they are the opinion of the team maintaining the knowledge base. This fact must not individually be registered for all instances of properties provided by the maintaining team, because it would result in an endless recursion of whose opinion was the description of an opinion. Therefore, the use of instances of E13 Attribute Assignment marks the fact that the maintaining team is in general neutral to the validity of the respective assertion, but registers someone else’s opinion and how it came about.\nAll properties assigned in such an action can also be seen as directly relating the respective pair of items or concepts. Multiple use of instances of E13 Attribute Assignment may possibly lead to a collection of contradictory values.\n\nExamples:\n- the examination of MS Sinai Greek 418 by Nicholas Pickwoad in November 2003 (Honey & Pickwoad, 2010)\n- the assessment of the current ownership of Martin Doerr’s silver cup in February 1997 (fictitious)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E13(x) ⇒ E7(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises all persistent physical items with a relatively stable form, human-made or natural.\nDepending on the existence of natural boundaries of such things, the CIDOC CRM distinguishes the instances of E19 Physical Object from instances of E26 Physical Feature, such as holes, rivers, pieces of land, etc. Most instances of E19 Physical Object can be moved (if not too heavy), whereas features are integral to the surrounding matter.\nAn instance of E18 Physical Thing occupies not only a particular geometric space at any instant of its existence, but in the course of its existence it also forms a trajectory through spacetime, which occupies a real, that is phenomenal, volume in spacetime. We include in the occupied space the space filled by the matter of the physical thing and all its inner spaces, such as the interior of a box. For the purpose of more detailed descriptions of the presence of an instance of E18 Physical Thing in space and time it can be associated with its specific instance of E92 Spacetime Volume by the property P196 defines (is defined by). \nThe CIDOC CRM is generally not concerned with amounts of matter in fluid or gaseous states, as long as they are not confined in an identifiable way for an identifiable minimal time-span.\n\nExamples:\n- the Cullinan Diamond (E19) (Scarratt and Shor, 2006)\n- the cave “Ideon Andron” in Crete (E26) (Smith, 1844-49)\n- the Mona Lisa (E22) (Mohen, 2006)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E18(x) ⇒ E72(x)\n

Typically, instances of E19 Physical Object can be moved (if not too heavy).\nIn some contexts, such objects, except for aggregates, are also called “bona fide objects”, i.e. naturally defined objects (Smith & Varzi, 2000). \nThe decision as to what is documented as a complete item, rather than by its parts or components, may be purely administrative or may be a result of the order in which the item was acquired.\n\nExamples:\n- Aphrodite of Milos (E22) (Kousser, 2005)\n- the Cullinan Diamond (Scarratt and Shor, 2006)\n- Apollo 13 at the time of launch (E22) (Lovell and Kluger, 1994)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E19(x) ⇒ E18(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises all persistent physical items of any size that are purposely created by human activity. This class comprises, besides others, human-made objects, such as a sword, and human-made features, such as rock art. For example, a “cup and ring” carving on bedrock is regarded as instance of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing.\nInstances of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing may be the result of modifying pre-existing physical things, preserving larger parts or most of the original matter and structure, which poses the question if they are new or even human-made, the respective interventions of production made on such original material should be obvious and sufficient to regard that the product has a new, distinct identity and intended function and is human-made. Substantial continuity of the previous matter and structure in the new product can be documented by describing the production process also as an instance of E81 Transformation.\nWhereas interventions of conservation and repair are not regarded to produce a new instance of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing, the results of preparation of natural history specimens that substantially change their natural or original state should be regarded as instances of E24 Physical Human-Made Things, including the uncovering of petrified biological features from a solid piece of stone. On the other side, scribbling a museum number on a natural object should not be regarded to make it human-made. This notwithstanding, parts, sections, segments, or features of an instance of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing may continue to be non-human-made and preserved during the production process, for example natural pearls used as a part of an eardrop.\n\nExamples:\n- the Forth Railway Bridge (Shipway, Bouch, Baker and Fowler, 1990).\n- the Channel Tunnel (E25) (Holliday, Marcou and Vickerman, 1991)\n- the Palace of Knossos (Evans, 1921)\n- the Colosseum in Rome, Italy (Hopkins and Beard, 2011)\n- the Historical Collection of the Museum Benaki in Athens (E78) (Georgoula, 2005)\n- the Rosetta Stone (E22)\n- my paperback copy of Crime & Punishment (E22) (fictitious)\n- the computer disk at ICS-FORTH that stores the canonical Definition of the CIDOC CRM v.3.2 (E22)\n- my empty DVD disk (E22) (fictitious)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E24(x) ⇒ E18(x)\n- E24(x) ⇒ E71(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises non-material products of our minds and other human produced data that have become objects of a discourse about their identity, circumstances of creation, or historical implication. The production of such information might have been supported by the use of technical devices such as cameras or computers.\nCharacteristically, instances of this class are created, invented or thought by someone, and then may be documented or communicated between persons. Instances of E28 Conceptual Object have the ability to exist on more than one particular carrier at the same time, such as paper, electronic signals, marks, audio media, paintings, photos, human memories, etc.\nThey cannot be destroyed. They exist as long as they can be found on at least one carrier or in at least one human memory. Their existence ends when the last carrier and the last memory are lost.\n\nExamples:\n- Beethoven’s “Ode an die Freude” (Ode to Joy) (E73) (Kershaw, 1999)\n- the definition of “ontology” in the Oxford English Dictionary (E73) (Oxford University Press, 1989)\n- the knowledge about the victory at Marathon carried by the famous runner (E89) (Lagos & Karyanos, 2020)\n- [Explanation note: The following examples illustrate the distinction between a propositional object, its names and its encoded forms.

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises all phenomena, such as the instances of E4 Periods and E5 Events, which happen over a limited extent in time. This extent in time must be contiguous, i.e., without gaps. In case the defining kinds of phenomena for an instance of E2 Temporal Entity cease to happen, and occur later again at another time, we regard that the former instance of E2 Temporal Entity has ended and a new instance has come into existence. In more intuitive terms, the same event cannot happen twice.\nIn some contexts, such phenomena are also called perdurants. This class is disjoint from E77 Persistent Item and is an abstract class that typically has no direct instances. E2 Temporal Entity is specialized into E4 Period, which applies to a particular geographic area (defined with a greater or lesser degree of precision), and E3 Condition State, which applies to instances of E18 Physical Thing.\n\nExamples:\n- Bronze Age (E4) (Childe, 1963)\n- the earthquake in Lisbon 1755 (E5) (Chester, 2001)\n- the Peterhof Palace near Saint Petersburg being in ruins from 1944 to 1946 (E3) (Maddox, 2015)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E2(x) ⇒ E1(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises identifiable expressions in natural language or languages. \nInstances of E33 Linguistic Object can be expressed in many ways: e.g. as written texts, recorded speech, or sign language. However, the CIDOC CRM treats instances of E33 Linguistic Object independently from the medium or method by which they are expressed. Expressions in formal languages, such as computer code or mathematical formulae, are not treated as instances of E33 Linguistic Object by the CIDOC CRM. These should be modelled as instances of E73 Information Object.\nIn general, an instance of E33 Linguistic Object may also contain non-linguistic information, often of artistic or aesthetic value. Only in cases in which the content of an instance of E33 Linguistic Object can completely be expressed by a series of binary-encoded symbols, its content may be documented within a respective knowledge base by the property P190 has symbolic content: E62 String. Otherwise, it should be understood as an identifiable digital resource only available independently from the respective knowledge base. \nIn other cases, such as pages of an illuminated manuscript or recordings containing speech in a language supported by a writing system, the linguistic part of the content of an instance of E33 Linguistic Object may be documented within a respective knowledge base in a note by P3 has note: E62 String. Otherwise, it may be described using the property P165 incorporates (is incorporated in): E73 Information Object as a different object with its own identity.\n\nExamples:\n- the text of the Ellesmere Chaucer manuscript (Hilmo, 2019)\n- the lyrics of the song “Blue Suede Shoes” (Cooper, 2008)\n- the text of the “Jabberwocky” by Lewis Carroll (Carroll, 1981)\n- the text of “Doktoro Jekyll kaj Sinjoro Hyde” [an Esperanto translation of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]. (Stevenson, Morrison and Mann, 1909)\n- the free dialog in the local dialect recorded in 1958, Telemark, Norway stored on tape or.7-89.s1 (00.15:46-00:34), The Language Collection at the University Library in Bergen, Norway (verified on 2020)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E33(x) ⇒ E73(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises the intellectual or conceptual aspects of recognisable marks and images.\nThis class does not intend to describe the idiosyncratic characteristics of an individual physical embodiment of a visual item, but the underlying prototype. For example, a mark such as the ICOM logo is generally considered to be the same logo when used on any number of publications. The size, orientation, and colour may change, but the logo remains uniquely identifiable. The same is true of images that are reproduced many times. This means that visual items are independent of their physical support.\nThe E36 Visual Item class provides a means of identifying and linking together instances of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing that carry the same visual symbols, marks, or images, etc. The property P62 depicts (is depicted by) between E24 Physical Human-Made Thing and the depicted subjects (E1 CRM Entity) can be regarded as a shortcut of the more fully developed path from E24 Physical Human-Made Thing through P65 shows visual item (is shown by), E36 Visual Item, P138 represents (has representation) to E1 CRM Entity, which in addition captures the optical features of the depiction.\n\nExamples:\n- the visual appearance of Monet’s “La Pie” (Bortolatto, 1981)\n- the Coca-Cola logo (E34)\n- the Chi-Rho (E37)\n- the communist red star (E37)\n- the surface shape of Auguste Rodin's statue "Le Penseur" [There exist more than 20 copies, even of different size. Therefore, this is a good example that it is only the common surface shape, an immaterial visual item, which justifies displaying these copies as works of Auguste Rodin. As usual practice, Rodin himself did not produce the bronze statue, but only the prototype model.]\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E36(x) ⇒ E73(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises the states of objects characterised by a certain condition over a time-span. \nAn instance of this class describes the prevailing physical condition of any material object or feature during a specific instance of E52 Time-Span. In general, the time-span for which a certain condition can be asserted may be shorter than the real time-span, for which this condition held.\nThe nature of that condition can be described using P2 has type. For example, the instance of E3 Condition State “condition of the SS Great Britain between 22(nd) September 1846 and 27(th) August 1847” can be characterized as an instance “wrecked” of E55 Type.\n\nExamples:\n- the "reconstructed" state of the “Amber Room” in Tsarskoje Selo from summer 2003 until now (Owen, 2009)\n- the "ruined" state of Peterhof Palace near Saint Petersburg from 1944 to 1946 (Maddox, 2015)\n- the state of my turkey in the oven at 14:30 on 25(th) December 2002 [P2 has type: E55 Type “still not cooked”] (fictitious)\n- the topography of the leaves of Sinai Printed Book 3234.2361 on the 10(th) July 2007 [described as: of type "cockled"] (fictitious)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E3(x) ⇒ E2(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises identifiable immaterial items, such as poems, jokes, data sets, images, texts, multimedia objects, procedural prescriptions, computer program code, algorithm or mathematical formulae, that have an objectively recognizable structure and are documented as single units. The encoding structure known as a “named graph” also falls under this class, so that each “named graph” is an instance of E73 Information Object.\nAn instance of E73 Information Object does not depend on a specific physical carrier, which can include human memory, and it can exist on one or more carriers simultaneously.\nInstances of E73 Information Object of a linguistic nature should be declared as instances of the E33 Linguistic Object subclass. Instances of E73 Information Object of a documentary nature should be declared as instances of the E31 Document subclass. Conceptual items such as types and classes are not instances of E73 Information Object, nor are ideas without a reproducible expression.\n\nExamples:\n- image BM000038850.JPG from the Clayton Herbarium in London (E31) (Natural History Museum, 2021)\n- E.

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises items that have persistent characteristics of structural nature substantially related to their identity and their integrity, sometimes known as “endurants” in philosophy. Persistent Items may be physical entities, such as people, animals or things, conceptual entities such as ideas, concepts, products of the imagination or even names. \nInstances of E77 Persistent Item may be present or be part of interactions in different periods or events. They can repeatedly be recognized at disparate occasions during their existence by characteristics of structural nature. The respective characteristics need not be exactly the same during all the existence of an instance of E77 Persistent Item. Often, they undergo gradual change, still bearing some similarities with that of previous times, or disappear completely and new emerge. For instance, a person, from the time of being born on, will gradually change all its features and acquire new ones, such as a scar. Even the DNA in different body cells will develop defects and mutations. Nevertheless, relevant characteristics used should be sufficiently similar to recognize the instance for some substantial period of time. \nThe more specific criteria that determine the identity of instances of subclasses of E77 Persistent Item may vary considerably and are described or referred to in the respective scope notes. The decision about which exact criteria to use depends on whether the observable behaviour of the respective part of reality such confined conforms to the reasoning the user is interested in. For example, a building can be regarded as no longer existing if it is dismantled and the materials reused in a different configuration. On the other hand, human beings go through radical and profound changes during their life-span, affecting both material composition and form, yet preserve their identity by other criteria, such as being bodily separated from other persons. Similarly, inanimate objects may be subject to exchange of parts and matter. On the opposite, the identity of a (version of a) text of a scientific publication is given by the exact arrangement of its relevant symbols. \nThe main classes of objects that fall outside the scope of the E77 Persistent Item class are temporal objects such as periods, events and acts, and descriptive properties. \nAn instance of E77 Persistent Item does not require actual knowledge of the identifying features of the instance being currently known. There may be cases, where the actual identifying features of an instance of E77 Persistent Item are not decidable at a particular state of knowledge.\n\nExamples:\n- Leonardo da Vinci (E21) (Strano, 1953)\n- Stonehenge (E24) (Pryor, 2016)\n- the hole in the ozone layer (E4) (Hufford and Horwitz, 2005)\n- the First Law of Thermodynamics (E89) (Craig and Gislason, 2002)\n- the Bermuda Triangle (E53) (Dolan, 2005)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E77(x) ⇒ E1(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises aggregations of instances of E18 Physical Thing that are assembled and maintained (“curated” and “preserved,” in museological terminology) by one or more instances of E39 Actor over time for a specific purpose and audience, and according to a particular collection development plan. Typical instances of curated holdings are museum collections, archives, library holdings and digital libraries. A digital library is regarded as an instance of E18 Physical Thing because it requires keeping physical carriers of the electronic content.\nItems may be added or removed from an E78 Curated Holding in pursuit of this plan. This class should not be confused with the E39 Actor maintaining the E78 Curated Holding who is often referred to using the name of the E78 Curated Holding (e.g. “The Wallace Collection decided…”). \nCollective objects in the general sense, like a tomb full of gifts, a folder with stamps, or a set of chessmen, should be documented as instances of E19 Physical Object, and not as instances of E78 Curated Holding. This is because they form wholes, either because they are physically bound together or because they are kept together for their functionality.\n\nExamples:\n- the John Clayton Herbarium (Blake, 1918), (Natural History Museum, 2021)\n- the Wallace Collection (Ingamells, 1990)\n- Mikael Heggelund Foslie’s coralline red algae Herbarium at the Museum of Natural History and Archaeology, Trondheim, Norway (Woelkerling et al., 2005)\n- the Digital Collections of the Munich DigitiZation Center (MDZ) accessible via https://www.digitale-sammlungen.de/ at least in January 2018.\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E78(x) ⇒ E24(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises identifiable symbols and any aggregation of symbols, such as characters, identifiers, traffic signs, emblems, texts, data sets, images, musical scores, multimedia objects, computer program code, or mathematical formulae that have an objectively recognizable structure and that are documented as single units.\nIt includes sets of signs of any nature, which may serve to designate something, or to communicate some propositional content. An instance of E90 Symbolic Object may or may not have a specific meaning, for example an arbitrary character string.\nIn some cases, the content of an instance of E90 Symbolic Object may completely be represented by a serialized digital content model, such as a sequence of ASCII-encoded characters, an XML or HTML document, or a TIFF image. The property P3 has note and its subproperty P190 has symbolic content allow for the description of this content model. In order to disambiguate which symbolic level is the carrier of the meaning, the property P3.1 has type can be used to specify the encoding (e.g. “bit”, “Latin character”, RGB pixel).\n\nExamples:\n- ‘ecognizabl’\n- the “no-smoking” sign (E36)\n- “BM000038850.JPG” (E41) [identifies a digital image] (Natural History Museum, 2021)\n- image BM000038850.JPG from the Clayton Herbarium in London (E36) [depicts specimen of Verbesina virginica] (Natural History Museum, 2021)\n- the distribution of form, tone and colour found on Leonardo da Vinci’s painting named “Mona Lisa” in daylight (E36)\n- the Italian text of Dante’s “Divina Commedia” as found in the authoritative critical edition “La Commedia secondo l’antica vulgata a cura di Giorgio Petrocchi” (E33) (Petrocchi, 1967)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E90(x) ⇒ E28(x)\n- E90(x) ⇒ E72(x)\n

comment: Scope note:\nThis class comprises 4-dimensional point sets (volumes) in physical spacetime (in contrast to mathematical models of it) regardless of their true geometric forms. They may derive their identity from being the extent of a material phenomenon or from being the interpretation of an expression defining an extent in spacetime. Intersections of instances of E92 Spacetime Volume, E53 Place, and E52 Time-Span are also regarded as instances of E92 Spacetime Volume. An instance of E92 Spacetime Volume is either contiguous or composed of a finite number of contiguous subsets. Its boundaries may be fuzzy due to the properties of the phenomena it derives from or due to the limited precision up to which defining expression can be identified with a real extent in spacetime. The duration of existence of an instance of E92 Spacetime Volume is its projection on time.\n\nExamples:\n- the extent in space and time of the Event of Caesar’s murder (Irwin, 1935)\n- where and when the carbon 14 dating of the “Schoeninger Speer II” in 1996 took place (Kouwenhoven, 1997)\n- the spatio-temporal trajectory of the H.M.S. Victory from its building to its actual location (Goodwin, 2015)\n- the extent in space and time defined by a polygon approximating the Danube river flood in Austria between 6(th) and 9(th) August 2002\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E92(x) ⇒ E1(x)\n

comment: Quantification of the inverse property: many to many, necessary (1,n:0,n)\n\nScope note of the inverse property:\nThis property describes the spatial location of an instance of E4 Period. \nThe related instance of E53 Place should be seen as a wider approximation of the geometric area within which the phenomena that characterise the period in question occurred, see below. P7 took place at (witnessed) does not convey any meaning other than spatial positioning (frequently on the surface of the earth). For example, the period “Révolution française” can be said to have taken place in “France in 1789”; the “Victorian” period may be said to have taken place in “Britain from 1837-1901” and its colonies, as well as other parts of Europe and North America. An instance of E4 Period can take place at multiple non-contiguous, non-overlapping locations.\nAny place where something happened includes the spatial projection of the happening given in the same geometric reference system. For instance, HMS Victory, as place of Lord Nelson's dying, includes the location of his body relative to the hull of HMS Victory at his time of death as the most precise location of his death. By the definition of P161 has spatial projection, an instance of E4 Period takes place on all its spatial projections to respective reference systems, that is, instances of E53 Place. Therefore, this property implies the more fully developed path from E4 Period through P161 has spatial projection, E53 Place, P89 falls within to E53 Place, where both places are defined in the same geometric reference system. The relation between an instance of E53 Place and its reference system can conveniently be documented via the property P157 is at rest relative to (provides reference space for).\nSomething that has happened at a given place can also be considered to have happened at a smaller place within it: for example, it is reasonable to say Caesar’s murder took place in Rome, but also on the Forum Romanum, and more precisely in the Curia. It is characteristic for different historical sources to use varying precision in such statements, without being in contradiction with each other. This may be due to lack of knowledge or to the relevance of the precision for the purpose of the statement. In information integration, the more precise statement improves the overall knowledge.\n\nExamples of the inverse property:\n- The period “Révolution française” (E4) took place at the area covered by France in 1789 (E53). (Bertaud, 2004)\n\nIn First Order Logic of the inverse property:\n- P7(x,y) ⇒ E4(x)\n- P7(x,y) ⇒ E53(y)\n- P7(x,y) ⇒ (∃z,u) [P157(y,u) ˄ P157(z,u) ˄ P161(x,z) ˄ P89(z,y)]\n- [E4(x) ˄ P157(y,u) ˄ P157(v,u) ˄ P7(x,y) ˄ P161(x,z) ˄ P89(z,v) ˄ P89(v,y)] ⇒ P7(x,v)\n

comment: Quantification of the inverse property: many to many (0,n:0,n)\n\nScope note of the inverse property:\nThis property associates an instance of E35 Title that has been applied to an instance of E71 Human-Made Thing. \nThe P102.1 has type property of the P102 has title (is title of) property enables the relationship between the title and the thing to be further clarified, for example, if the title was a given title, a supplied title etc.\nIt allows any human-made material or immaterial thing to be given a title. It is possible to imagine a title being created without a specific object in mind.\n\nExamples of the inverse property:\n- The first book of the Old Testament (E33) has title “Genesis” (E35) has type translated title (E55) (E55). (Brueggemann, 1982)\n- Monet’s painting from 1868-1869 held by Musée d’Orsay, Paris, under inventory number RF 1984 164 (E22) has title “La Pie” (E35) has type creator’s title (E55). (Musée d’Orsay, 2020)\n- Monet’s painting from 1868-1869 held by Musée d'Orsay, Paris, under inventory number RF 1984 164 (E22) has title “The Magpie” (E35) has type translated title (E55). (Musée d'Orsay, 2020)\n\nIn First Order Logic of the inverse property:\n- P102(x,y) ⇒ E71(x)\n- P102(x,y) ⇒ E35(y) \n- P102(x,y,z) ⇒ [P102(x,y) ∧ E55(z)]\n- P102(x,y) ⇒ P1(x,y)\n

comment: Quantification: many to many (0,n:0,n)\n\nScope note:\nThis property describes the active or passive participation of instances of E39 Actors in an instance of E5 Event. \nIt documents known events in which an instance of E39 Actor has participated during the course of that actor’s life or history. The instances of E53 Place and E52 Time-Span where and when these events happened provide constraints about the presence of the related instances of E39 Actor in the past. Collective actors, i.e. instances of E74 Group, may physically participate in events via their representing instances of E21 Persons only. The participation of multiple actors in an event is most likely an indication of their acquaintance and interaction.\nThe property implies that the actor was involved in the event but does not imply any causal relationship. For instance, someone having been portrayed can be said to have participated in the creation of the portrait.\n\nExamples:\n- Napoleon (E21) participated in The Battle of Waterloo (E7). (Dawson, 2018)\n- Maria (E21) participated in Photographing of Maria (E7). (fictitious)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- P11(x,y) ⇒ E5(x)\n- P11(x,y) ⇒ E39(y) \n- P11(x,y) ⇒ P12(x,y)\n

comment: Quantification of the inverse property: many to many (0,n:0,n)\n\nScope note of the inverse property:\nThis property describes the active or passive participation of instances of E39 Actors in an instance of E5 Event. \nIt documents known events in which an instance of E39 Actor has participated during the course of that actor’s life or history. The instances of E53 Place and E52 Time-Span where and when these events happened provide constraints about the presence of the related instances of E39 Actor in the past. Collective actors, i.e. instances of E74 Group, may physically participate in events via their representing instances of E21 Persons only. The participation of multiple actors in an event is most likely an indication of their acquaintance and interaction.\nThe property implies that the actor was involved in the event but does not imply any causal relationship. For instance, someone having been portrayed can be said to have participated in the creation of the portrait.\n\nExamples of the inverse property:\n- Napoleon (E21) participated in The Battle of Waterloo (E7). (Dawson, 2018)\n- Maria (E21) participated in Photographing of Maria (E7). (fictitious)\n\nIn First Order Logic of the inverse property:\n- P11(x,y) ⇒ E5(x)\n- P11(x,y) ⇒ E39(y) \n- P11(x,y) ⇒ P12(x,y)\n

comment: Quantification: many to many (0,n:0,n)\n\nScope note:\nThis property generalises the notions of “copy of” and “similar to” into a directed relationship, where the domain expresses the derivative or influenced item and the range the source or influencing item, if such a direction can be established. The property can also be used to express similarity in cases that can be stated between two objects only, without historical knowledge about its reasons. The property expresses a symmetric relationship in case no direction of influence can be established either from evidence on the item itself or from historical knowledge. This holds in particular for siblings of a derivation process from a common source or non-causal cultural parallels, such as some weaving patterns.\nThe P130.1 kind of similarity property of the P130 shows features of (features are also found on) property enables the relationship between the domain and the range to be further clarified, in the sense from domain to range, if applicable. For example, it may be expressed if both items are product “of the same mould”, or if two texts “contain identical paragraphs”. \nIf the reason for similarity is a sort of derivation process, i.e. that the creator has used or had in mind the form of a particular thing during the creation or production, this process should be explicitly modelled. In these cases, P130 shows features of can be regarded as a shortcut of such a process. However, the current model does not contain any path specific enough to infer this property. Specializations of the CIDOC CRM may however be more explicit, for instance describing the use of moulds etc.\nThis property is not transitive. This property is irreflexive.\n\nExamples:\n- Mary Lamb’s Cymbeline from Charles and Mary Lamb’s Tales from Shakespeare (E89) shows features of William Shakespeare’s Cymbeline (E89). (Carrington, 1954)\n- The audio recording of Dante Alighieri’s La divina commedia read by Enrico de Negri (E73) shows features of the text of Dante Alighieri’s La divina commedia (E89).

This property is part of the fully developed path from E24 Physical Human-Made Thing through P65 shows visual item (is shown by), E36 Visual Item, P138 represents (has representation) to E1 CRM Entity, which is shortcut by P62 depicts (is depicted by). P138.1 mode of representation allows the nature of the representation to be refined.\nThis property is also used for the relationship between an original and a digitisation of the original by the use of techniques such as digital photography, flatbed or infrared scanning. Digitisation is here seen as a process with a mechanical, causal component rendering the spatial distribution of structural and optical properties of the original and does not necessarily include any visual similarity identifiable by human observation.\n\nExamples of the inverse property:\n- The digital file found at https://www.emunch.no/N/full/No-MM_N0001-01.jpg (E36) represents page 1 of Edward Munch's manuscript MM N 1, Munch-museet (E22) mode of representation Digitisation (E55).\n- The 3D model VAM_A.200-1946_trace_1M.ply (E73) represents Victoria & Albert Museum’s Madonna and child sculpture (visual work) A.200-1946 (E22) mode of representation 3D surface (E55).\n\nIn First Order Logic of the inverse property:\n- P138(x,y) ⇒ E36(x)\n- P138(x,y) ⇒ E1(y) \n- P138(x,y,z) ⇒ [P138(x,y) ∧ E55(z)]\n- P138(x,y) ⇒ P67(x,y)\n

Overall descriptions of the structure of an instance of E18 Physical Thing are captured by the P3 has note property.\nThe instances of E57 Material of which an instance of E18 Physical Thing is composed should be documented using P45 consists of (is incorporated in).\nThis property is transitive and asymmetric.\n\nExamples of the inverse property:\n- The Royal carriage (E22) forms part of the Royal train (E22).\n- The “Hog’s Back” (E24) forms part of the “Fosseway” (E24).\n\nIn First Order Logic of the inverse property:\n- P46(x,y) ⇒ E18(x)\n- P46(x,y) ⇒ E18(y)\n- P46(x,y) ⇒ P132(x,y)\n- [P46(x,y) ∧ P46(y,z)] ⇒ P46(x,z)\n- P46(x,y) ⇒ (∃uzw)[E93(u) ∧ P195i (x,u) ∧ E52(z) ∧ P164(u,z) ∧ E93(w) ∧ P195i (w,y) ∧ P164(w,z) ∧ P10(w,u)] \n- P46(x,y) ⇒ ¬P46(y,x)\n

For example, the period “Révolution française” can be said to have taken place in “France in 1789”; the “Victorian” period may be said to have taken place in “Britain from 1837-1901” and its colonies, as well as other parts of Europe and North America. An instance of E4 Period can take place at multiple non-contiguous, non-overlapping locations.\nAny place where something happened includes the spatial projection of the happening given in the same geometric reference system. For instance, HMS Victory, as place of Lord Nelson's dying, includes the location of his body relative to the hull of HMS Victory at his time of death as the most precise location of his death. By the definition of P161 has spatial projection, an instance of E4 Period takes place on all its spatial projections to respective reference systems, that is, instances of E53 Place. Therefore, this property implies the more fully developed path from E4 Period through P161 has spatial projection, E53 Place, P89 falls within to E53 Place, where both places are defined in the same geometric reference system. The relation between an instance of E53 Place and its reference system can conveniently be documented via the property P157 is at rest relative to (provides reference space for).\nSomething that has happened at a given place can also be considered to have happened at a smaller place within it: for example, it is reasonable to say Caesar’s murder took place in Rome, but also on the Forum Romanum, and more precisely in the Curia. It is characteristic for different historical sources to use varying precision in such statements, without being in contradiction with each other. This may be due to lack of knowledge or to the relevance of the precision for the purpose of the statement. In information integration, the more precise statement improves the overall knowledge.\n\nExamples:\n- The period “Révolution française” (E4) took place at the area covered by France in 1789 (E53). (Bertaud, 2004)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- P7(x,y) ⇒ E4(x)\n- P7(x,y) ⇒ E53(y)\n- P7(x,y) ⇒ (∃z,u) [P157(y,u) ˄ P157(z,u) ˄ P161(x,z) ˄ P89(z,y)]\n- [E4(x) ˄ P157(y,u) ˄ P157(v,u) ˄ P7(x,y) ˄ P161(x,z) ˄ P89(z,v) ˄ P89(v,y)] ⇒ P7(x,v)\n
