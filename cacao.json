        "comments" : [ "Scope note:\nThis class comprises the actions of making assertions about one property of an object or any single relation between two items or concepts. The type of the property asserted to hold between two items or concepts can be described by the property P177 assigned property of type (is type of property assigned): E55 Type. \nFor example, the class describes the actions of people making propositions and statements during certain scientific/scholarly procedures, e.g. the person and date when a condition statement was made, an identifier was assigned, the museum object was measured, etc. Which kinds of such assignments and statements need to be documented explicitly in structures of a schema rather than free text, depends on whether this information should be accessible by structured queries.\nThis class allows for the documentation of how the respective assignment came about, and whose opinion it was. Note that all instances of properties described in a knowledge base are the opinion of someone. Per default, they are the opinion of the team maintaining the knowledge base. This fact must not individually be registered for all instances of properties provided by the maintaining team, because it would result in an endless recursion of whose opinion was the description of an opinion. Therefore, the use of instances of E13 Attribute Assignment marks the fact that the maintaining team is in general neutral to the validity of the respective assertion, but registers someone else’s opinion and how it came about.\nAll properties assigned in such an action can also be seen as directly relating the respective pair of items or concepts. Multiple use of instances of E13 Attribute Assignment may possibly lead to a collection of contradictory values.\n\nExamples:\n- the examination of MS Sinai Greek 418 by Nicholas Pickwoad in November 2003 (Honey & Pickwoad, 2010)\n- the assessment of the current ownership of Martin Doerr’s silver cup in February 1997 (fictitious)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E13(x) ⇒ E7(x)\n" ],

        "comments" : [ "Scope note:\nThis class comprises actions measuring physical properties and other values that can be determined by a systematic, objective procedure of direct observation of particular states of physical reality. \nAn instance of E16 Measurement may use simple counting or tools, such as yardsticks or radiation detection devices. The interest is in the method and care applied, so that the reliability of the result may be judged at a later stage, or research continued on the associated documents. The date of the event is important for dimensions, which may change value over time, such as the length of an object subject to shrinkage. Methods and devices employed should be associated with instances of E16 Measurement by properties such as P33 used specific technique: E29 Design or Procedure, P125 used object of type: E55 Type, P16 used specific object (was used for): E70 Thing, whereas basic techniques such as \"carbon-14 dating\" should be encoded using P2 has type (is type of): E55 Type. Details of methods and devices reused or reusable in other instances of E16 Measurement should be documented for these entities rather than the measurements themselves, whereas details of particular execution may be documented by free text or by instantiating adequate sub-activities, if the detail may be of interest for an overarching query.\nRegardless whether a measurement is made by an instrument or by human senses, it represents the initial transition from physical reality to information without any other documented information object in between within the reasoning chain that would represent the result of the interaction of the observer or device with reality. Therefore, determining properties of an instance of E90 Symbolic Object is regarded as an instance of E13 Attribute Assignment, which may be inferred from observing and measuring representative carriers. In the case that the carrier can be named, the property P16 used specific object (was used for) should be used to indicate the instance(s) of E18 Physical Thing that was used as the empirical basis for the attribute assignment. For instance, inferring properties of depicted items using image material, such as satellite images, is not regarded as an instance of E16 Measurement, but as a subsequent instance of E13 Attribute Assignment. Rather, only the production of the images, understood as arrays of radiation intensities, is regarded as an instance of E16 Measurement. The same reasoning holds for other sensor data.\n\nExamples:\n- measurement of the height of silver cup 232 on 31(st) August 1997 (fictitious)\n- the carbon 14 dating of the “Schoeninger Speer II” in 1996 [The carbon 14 dating of an approximately 400.000 year old complete Old Palaeolithic wooden spear found in Schoeningen, Niedersachsen, Germany, in 1995.] (Kouwenhoven, 1997)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E16(x) ⇒ E13(x)\n" ],

For example, a “cup and ring” carving on bedrock is regarded as instance of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing.\nInstances of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing may be the result of modifying pre-existing physical things, preserving larger parts or most of the original matter and structure, which poses the question if they are new or even human-made, the respective interventions of production made on such original material should be obvious and sufficient to regard that the product has a new, distinct identity and intended function and is human-made. Substantial continuity of the previous matter and structure in the new product can be documented by describing the production process also as an instance of E81 Transformation.\nWhereas interventions of conservation and repair are not regarded to produce a new instance of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing, the results of preparation of natural history specimens that substantially change their natural or original state should be regarded as instances of E24 Physical Human-Made Things, including the uncovering of petrified biological features from a solid piece of stone. On the other side, scribbling a museum number on a natural object should not be regarded to make it human-made. This notwithstanding, parts, sections, segments, or features of an instance of E24 Physical Human-Made Thing may continue to be non-human-made and preserved during the production process, for example natural pearls used as a part of an eardrop.\n\nExamples:\n- the Forth Railway Bridge (Shipway, Bouch, Baker and Fowler, 1990).\n- the Channel Tunnel (E25) (Holliday, Marcou and Vickerman, 1991)\n- the Palace of Knossos (Evans, 1921)\n- the Colosseum in Rome, Italy (Hopkins and Beard, 2011)\n- the Historical Collection of the Museum Benaki in Athens (E78) (Georgoula, 2005)\n- the Rosetta Stone (E22)\n- my paperback copy of Crime & Punishment (E22) (fictitious)\n- the computer disk at ICS-FORTH that stores the canonical Definition of the CIDOC CRM v.3.2 (E22)\n- my empty DVD disk (E22) (fictitious)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E24(x) ⇒ E18(x)\n- E24(x) ⇒ E71(x)\n" ],

        "comments" : [ "Scope note:\nThis class comprises sets of coherent phenomena or cultural manifestations occurring in time and space.\nIt is the social or physical coherence of these phenomena that identify an instance of E4 Period and not the associated spatiotemporal extent. This extent is only the “ground” or space in an abstract physical sense that the actual process of growth, spread and retreat has covered. Consequently, different periods can overlap and coexist in time and space, such as when a nomadic culture exists in the same area and time as a sedentary culture. This also means that overlapping land use rights, common among first nations, amounts to overlapping periods.\nOften, this class is used to describe prehistoric or historic periods such as the “Neolithic Period”, the “Ming Dynasty” or the “McCarthy Era”, but also geopolitical units and activities of settlements are regarded as special cases of E4 Period. However, there are no assumptions about the scale of the associated phenomena. In particular all events are seen as synthetic processes consisting of coherent phenomena. Therefore, E4 Period is a superclass of E5 Event. For example, a modern clinical birth, an instance of E67 Birth, can be seen as both a single event, i.e. an instance of E5 Event, and as an extended period, i.e. an instance of E4 Period, that consists of multiple physical processes and complementary activities performed by multiple instances of E39 Actor.\nE4 Period is a subclass of E2 Temporal Entity and of E92 Spacetime Volume. The latter is intended as a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CIDOC CRMgeo (Doerr & Hiebel, 2013). By virtue of this multiple inheritance, it is possible to discuss the physical extent of an instance of E4 Period without representing each instance of it together with an instance of its associated spacetime volume. This model combines two quite different kinds of substance: an instance of E4 Period is a phenomenon while an instance of E92 Spacetime Volume is an aggregation of points in spacetime. However, the real spatiotemporal extent of an instance of E4 Period is regarded to be unique to it due to all its details and fuzziness; its identity and existence depends uniquely on the identity of the instance of E4 Period. Therefore, this multiple inheritance is unambiguous and effective and furthermore corresponds to the intuitions of natural language.\nTypical use of this class in cultural heritage documentation is for documenting cultural and artistic periods. There are two different conceptualisations of ‘artistic style’, defined either by physical features or by historical context. For example, “Impressionism” can be viewed as a period in the European sphere of influence lasting from approximately 1870 to 1905 during which paintings with particular characteristics were produced by a group of artists that included (among others) Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley and Degas. Alternatively, it can be regarded as a style applicable to all paintings sharing the characteristics of the works produced by the Impressionist painters, regardless of historical context. The first interpretation is an instance of E4 Period, and the second defines morphological object types that fall under E55 Type.\nA geopolitical unit as a specific case of an instance of E4 Period is the set of activities and phenomena related to the claim of power, the consequences of belonging to a jurisdictional area and an administrative system that establishes a geopolitical unit. Examples from the modern period are countries or administrative areas of countries such as districts whose actions and structures define activities and phenomena in the area that they intend to govern. The borders of geopolitical units are often defined in contracts or treaties although they may deviate from the actual practice. The spatiotemporal properties of Geopolitical units can be modelled through the properties inherited from E92 Spacetime Volume.\nAnother specific case of an instance of E4 Period is the actual extent of the set of activities and phenomena as evidenced by their physical traces that define a settlement, such as the populated period of Nineveh.\n\nExamples:\n- Jurassic (Hallam, 1975)\n- Populated Period of Nineveh\n- Imperial Rome under Marcus Aurelius\n- European Bronze Age (Harrison, 2004) \n- Italian Renaissance (Macdonald, 1992)\n- Thirty Years War (Lee, 1991)\n- Sturm und Drang (Berkoff, 2013)\n- Cubism (Cox, 2000)\n- The Capital of Russia (E4) [the capital of Russia in the sense of an administrative unit moved in historical times from Moscow to St Petersburg and then back to Moscow. This exemplifies an administrative unit changing place over time without temporal discontinuity]\n- The settling activity of the community of Helsinki (a.k.a. Helsingfors) (E7) [the original settlement called Helsinki was located in the area of the modern airport. The community moved later to settle on the coast. This exemplifies a continued activity changing place over time without temporal discontinuity]\n- Bronze Age (E4) [Bronze Age, in the sense of technological adoption, spread over disjoint areas including islands such as the British Isles without temporal discontinuity]\n- Japan, the state (E4) [In 2021, the Japanese state as a political unit comprised in 6852 islands extending along the Pacific coast of Asia]\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E4(x) ⇒ E2(x)\n- E4(x) ⇒ E92(x)\n" ],

The actual extent of an instance of E52 Time-Span can be approximated by properties of E52 Time-Span giving inner and outer bounds in the form of dates (instances of E61 Time Primitive). Comparing knowledge about time-spans is fundamental for chronological reasoning.\nSome instances of E52 Time-Span may be defined as the actual, in principle observable, temporal extent of instances of E2 Temporal Entity via the property P4 has time-span (is time-span of): E52 Time-Span. They constitute phenomenal time-spans as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr & Hiebel 2013). Since our knowledge of history is imperfect and physical phenomena are fuzzy in nature, the extent of phenomenal time-spans can only be described in approximation. An extreme case of approximation, might, for example, define an instance of E52 Time-Span having unknown beginning, end and duration. It may, nevertheless, be associated with other descriptions by which people can infer knowledge about it, such as in relative chronologies.\nSome instances of E52 may be defined precisely as representing a declaration of a temporal extent, as, for instance, done in a business contract.

However, relative references are often more relevant in the context of cultural documentation and tend to be more precise. In particular, people are often interested in position in relation to large, mobile objects, such as ships. For example, the Place at which Nelson died is known with reference to a large mobile object, i.e. H.M.S Victory. A resolution of this Place in terms of absolute coordinates would require knowledge of the movements of the vessel and the precise time of death, either of which may be revised, and the result would lack historical and cultural relevance.\nAny instance of E18 Physical Thing can serve as a frame of reference for an instance of E53 Place.

        "comments" : [ "Scope note:\nThis class comprises quantifiable properties that can be measured by some calibrated means and can be approximated by values, i.e. points or regions in a mathematical or conceptual space, such as natural or real numbers, RGB values, etc.\nAn instance of E54 Dimension represents the empirical or theoretically derived quantity, including the precision tolerances resulting from the particular method or calculation. The identity of an instance of E54 Dimension depends on the method of its determination because each method may produce different values even when determining comparable qualities. For instance, the wingspan of a bird alive or dead is a different dimension. Thermoluminescence dating and Rehydroxylation [RHX] dating are different dimensions of temporal distance from now, even if they aim at dating the same object. The method of determination should be expressed using the property P2 has type (is type of). Note that simple terms such as “diameter” or “length” are normally insufficient to unambiguously describe a respective dimension. In contrast, “maximum linear extent” may be sufficient.\nThe properties of the class E54 Dimension allow for expressing the numerical approximation of the values of instances of E54 Dimension adequate to the precision of the applied method of determination. If the respective quantity belongs to a non-discrete space according to the laws of physics, such as spatial distances, it is recommended to record them as approximations by intervals or regions of indeterminacy enclosing the assumed true values. For instance, a length of 5 cm may be recorded as 4.5-5.5 cm, according to the precision of the respective observation. Note, that comparability of values described in different units depends critically on the representation as value regions.\nNumerical approximations in archaic instances of E58 Measurement Unit used in historical records should be preserved. Equivalents corresponding to current knowledge should be recorded as additional instances of E54 Dimension, as appropriate.\n\nExamples:\n- the weight of the Luxor Obelisk [250 metric tons]\n- the vertical height of the statue of David by Michelangelo [5.17 metres]\n- the weight of the Great Star of Africa diamond [530.2 carats]\n- the calibrated C14 date for the Shroud of Turin [AD1262-1312, 1303-1384]\n- the horizontal diameter of the Stonehenge Sarsen Circle [33 metres] (Pryor, 2016)\n- the length of the sides of the Great Pyramid at Giza [230.34 metres] (Lehner and Hawass, 2017)\n- the duration of the time-span of the Battle of Issos/Issus on 15(th) November 333 B.C.E.

Typical examples are meetings, births, deaths, actions of decision taking, making or inventing things, but also more complex and extended ones such as conferences, elections, building of a castle, or battles.\nWhile the continuous growth of a tree lacks the limits characteristic of an event, its germination from a seed does qualify as an event. Similarly, the blowing of the wind lacks the distinctness and limits of an event, but a hurricane, flood or earthquake would qualify as an event. Mental processes are considered as events, in cases where they are connected with the material externalization of their results; for example, the creation of a poem, a performance or a change of intention that becomes obvious from subsequent actions or declarations.\nThe effects of an instance of E5 Event may not lead to relevant permanent changes of properties or relations of the items involved in it, for example an unrecorded performance. Of course, in order to be documented, some kind of evidence for an event must exist, be it witnesses, traces or products of the event.\nWhile instances of E4 Period always require some form of coherence between its constituent phenomena, in addition, the essential constituents of instances of E5 Event should contribute to an overall effect; for example, the statements made during a meeting and the listening of the audience.\nViewed at a coarse level of detail, an instance of E5 Event may appear as if it had an ‘instantaneous’ overall effect, but any process or interaction of material nature in reality have an extent in time and space. At a fine level, instances of E5 Event may be analysed into component phenomena and phases within a space and timeframe, and as such can be seen as a period, regardless of the size of the phenomena. The reverse is not necessarily the case: not all instances of E4 Period give rise to a noteworthy overall effect and are thus not instances of E5 Event.\n\nExamples:\n- the birth of Cleopatra (E67) (Pomeroy, 1984)\n- the destruction of Herculaneum by volcanic eruption in 79 AD (E6) (Camardo, 2013)\n- World War II (E7) (Barber, 1994)\n- the Battle of Stalingrad (E7) (Hoyt, 1993)\n- the Yalta Conference (E7) (Harbutt, 2010)\n- my birthday celebration 28-6-1995 (E7)\n- the falling of a tile from my roof last Sunday (fictitious)\n- the CIDOC conference 2003 (E7)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E5(x) ⇒ E4(x)\n" ],

Persistent Items may be physical entities, such as people, animals or things, conceptual entities such as ideas, concepts, products of the imagination or even names. \nInstances of E77 Persistent Item may be present or be part of interactions in different periods or events. They can repeatedly be recognized at disparate occasions during their existence by characteristics of structural nature. The respective characteristics need not be exactly the same during all the existence of an instance of E77 Persistent Item. Often, they undergo gradual change, still bearing some similarities with that of previous times, or disappear completely and new emerge. For instance, a person, from the time of being born on, will gradually change all its features and acquire new ones, such as a scar. Even the DNA in different body cells will develop defects and mutations. Nevertheless, relevant characteristics used should be sufficiently similar to recognize the instance for some substantial period of time. \nThe more specific criteria that determine the identity of instances of subclasses of E77 Persistent Item may vary considerably and are described or referred to in the respective scope notes. The decision about which exact criteria to use depends on whether the observable behaviour of the respective part of reality such confined conforms to the reasoning the user is interested in. For example, a building can be regarded as no longer existing if it is dismantled and the materials reused in a different configuration. On the other hand, human beings go through radical and profound changes during their life-span, affecting both material composition and form, yet preserve their identity by other criteria, such as being bodily separated from other persons. Similarly, inanimate objects may be subject to exchange of parts and matter. On the opposite, the identity of a (version of a) text of a scientific publication is given by the exact arrangement of its relevant symbols. \nThe main classes of objects that fall outside the scope of the E77 Persistent Item class are temporal objects such as periods, events and acts, and descriptive properties. \nAn instance of E77 Persistent Item does not require actual knowledge of the identifying features of the instance being currently known. There may be cases, where the actual identifying features of an instance of E77 Persistent Item are not decidable at a particular state of knowledge.\n\nExamples:\n- Leonardo da Vinci (E21) (Strano, 1953)\n- Stonehenge (E24) (Pryor, 2016)\n- the hole in the ozone layer (E4) (Hufford and Horwitz, 2005)\n- the First Law of Thermodynamics (E89) (Craig and Gislason, 2002)\n- the Bermuda Triangle (E53) (Dolan, 2005)\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E77(x) ⇒ E1(x)\n" ],

Typical instances of curated holdings are museum collections, archives, library holdings and digital libraries. A digital library is regarded as an instance of E18 Physical Thing because it requires keeping physical carriers of the electronic content.\nItems may be added or removed from an E78 Curated Holding in pursuit of this plan. This class should not be confused with the E39 Actor maintaining the E78 Curated Holding who is often referred to using the name of the E78 Curated Holding (e.g. “The Wallace Collection decided…”). \nCollective objects in the general sense, like a tomb full of gifts, a folder with stamps, or a set of chessmen, should be documented as instances of E19 Physical Object, and not as instances of E78 Curated Holding. This is because they form wholes, either because they are physically bound together or because they are kept together for their functionality.\n\nExamples:\n- the John Clayton Herbarium (Blake, 1918), (Natural History Museum, 2021)\n- the Wallace Collection (Ingamells, 1990)\n- Mikael Heggelund Foslie’s coralline red algae Herbarium at the Museum of Natural History and Archaeology, Trondheim, Norway (Woelkerling et al., 2005)\n- the Digital Collections of the Munich DigitiZation Center (MDZ) accessible via https://www.digitale-sammlungen.de/ at least in January 2018.\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- E78(x) ⇒ E24(x)\n" ],

These movements are characterized by collective action, where individuals unite based on shared beliefs or objectives, often seeking social, political, economic, or cultural transformations. ​\n\nSocial movements differ from formal organizations in that they may lack a defined organizational structure or formal membership, relying instead on informal networks and shared commitments. They can vary widely in size and scope, ranging from localized grassroots initiatives to large-scale national or international campaigns. The methods employed can include protests, demonstrations, advocacy, and other forms of collective action aimed at influencing public opinion and policy. ​\n\nExamples:\n- The Civil Rights Movement in the United States,\n- The Environmental Movement\n- The Feminist Movement,\n- The LGBTQ+ Rights Movement" ],

For example, an object may be the desk, now in a museum, on which a treaty was signed. The instance of E53 Place and the instance of E52 Time-Span where and when these events happened provide constraints about the presence of the related instance E77 Persistent Item in the past. Instances of E90 Symbolic Object, in particular information objects, are physically present in events via at least one of the instances of E18 Physical Thing carrying them. Note, that the human mind can be such a carrier. A precondition for a transfer of information to a person or another new physical carrier is the presence of the respective information object and this person or physical thing in one event.\n\nExamples of the inverse property:\n- Deckchair 42 (E19) was present at the sinking of the Titanic (E5).

The spatial extent of the composing part is included in the spatial extent of the whole.\nComponent elements, since they are themselves instances of E18 Physical Thing, may be further analysed into sub-components, thereby creating a hierarchy of part decomposition. An instance of E18 Physical Thing may be shared between multiple wholes, for example two buildings may share a common wall. This property does not specify when and for how long a component element resided in the respective whole. If a component is not part of a whole from the beginning of existence or until the end of existence of the whole, the classes E79 Part Addition and E90 Part Removal can be used to document when a component became part of a particular whole and/or when it stopped being a part of it. For the time-span of being part of the respective whole, the component is completely contained in the place the whole occupies.\nThis property is intended to describe specific components that are individually documented, rather than general aspects. Overall descriptions of the structure of an instance of E18 Physical Thing are captured by the P3 has note property.\nThe instances of E57 Material of which an instance of E18 Physical Thing is composed should be documented using P45 consists of (is incorporated in).\nThis property is transitive and asymmetric.\n\nExamples of the inverse property:\n- The Royal carriage (E22) forms part of the Royal train (E22).\n- The “Hog’s Back” (E24) forms part of the “Fosseway” (E24).\n\nIn First Order Logic of the inverse property:\n- P46(x,y) ⇒ E18(x)\n- P46(x,y) ⇒ E18(y)\n- P46(x,y) ⇒ P132(x,y)\n- [P46(x,y) ∧ P46(y,z)] ⇒ P46(x,z)\n- P46(x,y) ⇒ (∃uzw)[E93(u) ∧ P195i (x,u) ∧ E52(z) ∧ P164(u,z) ∧ E93(w) ∧ P195i (w,y) ∧ P164(w,z) ∧ P10(w,u)] \n- P46(x,y) ⇒ ¬P46(y,x)\n" ],

The representation may be more specific than the symbolic level defining the identity condition of the represented. This depends on the type of the symbolic object represented. For instance, if a name has type “Modern Greek character sequence”, it may be represented in a loss-free Latin transcription, meaning however the sequence of Greek letters. \nAs another example, if the represented object has type “English words sequence”, American English or British English spelling variants may be chosen to represent the English word “colour” without defining a different symbolic object. If a name has type “European traditional name”, no particular string may define its content.\n\nExamples:\n- The materials description of the painting (E33) has symbolic content “Oil, French Watercolors on Paper, Graphite and Ink on Canvas, with an Oak frame.” (E62).\n- The title of Einstein’s 1915 text (E35) has symbolic content “Relativity, the Special and the General Theory” (E62). (Einstein, 2001)\n- The story of Little Red Riding Hood (E33) has symbolic content “Once upon a time there lived in a certain village.” (E62). (Lang, 1965)\n- The inscription on Rijksmuseum object SK-A-1601 (E34) has symbolic content “B” (E62). [reference: https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/SK-A-1601/catalogue-entry (accessed 10(th) April 2021)]\n\nIn First Order Logic:\n- P190(x,y) ⇒ E90(x)\n- P190(x,y) ⇒ E62(y)\n" ],

The aim is not to capture, in a structured form, everything that can be said about an item; indeed, the CIDOC CRM formalism is not regarded as sufficient to express everything that can be said. Good practice requires use of distinct note fields for different aspects of a characterisation. The P3.1 has type property of P3 has note allows differentiation of specific notes, e.g. “construction”, “decoration”, etc. \nAn item may have many notes, but a note is attached to a specific item.\n\nExamples:\n- Coffee mug – OXCMS:1983.1.1 (E19) has note “chipped at edge of handle” (E62) has type Condition (E55).

In\n      the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written \"2011/2012\"). Other forms of content, e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode, may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL.\n      Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via \"1939/1945\".<br/><br/>\n\nOpen-ended date ranges can be written with \"..\" in place of the end date.
